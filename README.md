# CodeLink
A Simulink Like IDE for C++ based on nana gui. 
By it developers are allowed to write code as well as draw blocks in just one environment.
Basic blocks should be developed by code, programmable and user defined. 
Developers can develop, test, and even sumulate their codes or blocks in CodeLink.
CodeLink should be able to generate executable file or script, which can be run on target machine. 
Tip: Source code is in a CodeBlocks project. 

It is a big idea, I need more people to help me to realize it.
